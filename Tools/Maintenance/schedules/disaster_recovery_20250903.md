## Emergency Response Protocol

### Phase 1: Assessment (0-15 minutes)

1. **Identify Failure Scope**

   - Check monitoring dashboard
   - Identify affected workflows
   - Assess impact on CI/CD pipeline

2. **Initial Containment**
   - Disable failing workflows
   - Notify development team
   - Start incident documentation

### Phase 2: Recovery (15-60 minutes)

1. **Data Backup Verification**

   - Verify recent backups exist
   - Check backup integrity
   - Prepare recovery environment

2. **System Recovery**
   - Restore from last known good state
   - Re-enable workflows gradually
   - Validate recovery success

### Phase 3: Validation (60+ minutes)

1. **Comprehensive Testing**

   - Run full test suite
   - Validate all workflows
   - Check integration points

2. **Performance Verification**
   - Monitor system performance
   - Check success rates
   - Validate user workflows

## Recovery Commands

### Quick Recovery

```bash
# Emergency workflow disable
gh workflow disable <workflow-name>

# Check system status
bash Tools/Automation/simple_monitoring.sh

# Validate recovery
bash Tools/Automation/deploy_workflows_all_projects.sh --validate
```

### Full System Recovery

```bash
# Restore from backup
git checkout <backup-branch>
git push origin main --force

# Re-enable all workflows
gh workflow enable --all

# Full system validation
bash Tools/Automation/master_automation.sh all
```

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

- **Daily**: Workflow configurations
- **Weekly**: Complete repository backup
- **Monthly**: Full system snapshot

### Manual Backups

- Before major changes
- After successful deployments
- When testing new features

### Backup Locations

- Local: `/Users/danielstevens/Desktop/Quantum-workspace/Tools/Maintenance/backups`
- Remote: GitHub repository branches
- Offsite: Encrypted archives

## Prevention Measures

### Proactive Monitoring

- Real-time alert system
- Performance monitoring
- Automated health checks

### Risk Mitigation

- Regular backup validation
- Staged deployment process
- Comprehensive testing
