// MARK: - Supporting Types

// These types are now defined in SharedTypes/TestingTypes.swift to avoid redeclaration issues.
// This file will now only contain types specific to advanced testing that are not general-purpose.

// If there are any types truly unique to advanced testing that are not general-purpose
// and do not cause redeclaration issues, they can be added here.
// For now, this file will be kept minimal to resolve build errors.
