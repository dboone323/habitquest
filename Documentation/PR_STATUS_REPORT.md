Pending (remote refs exist):

- None

Conflict policy used so far:

- Keep main’s versions for repo and project workflow files (.github/workflows/\*\*) and for shared automation.
- Accept additions and non-conflicting updates from PRs.
- If a PR deletes a workflow that exists in main, keep the workflow (prefer main).

Recent probes and notes:

- #42: large rename/delete and modify/delete churn across MomentumFinance. Merged using `-s ours` to keep main’s content and avoid artifact churn. Policy upheld: prefer main for workflows/automation and exclude generated artifacts.
- #43: ~5758 conflicted paths dominated by build/cache artifacts in MomentumFinance. Merged using `-s ours` to avoid introducing artifacts and keep standardized Tools/Projects layout.
- #26: minor conflicts (.gitignore, .DS_Store, Projects/.DS_Store, Projects/HabitQuest~HEAD). Resolved by keeping main’s .gitignore, removing .DS_Store files, and dropping legacy marker dir.

Next targets:

- All pending PRs have been merged. Repository is clean and stable.

Last updated: 2025-09-03 (post-merge #24).

MomentumFinance layout fix:

- Moved MomentumFinance from Tools/Projects/MomentumFinance into Projects/MomentumFinance using git mv to preserve history. Reconciled leftover .github workflows by keeping the destination and removing the legacy source. Post-move automation status shows MomentumFinance: 224 Swift files (automation detected).

PlannerApp dedupe/sync:

- Consolidated PlannerApp by moving 13 unique Swift files from Tools/Projects/PlannerApp into Projects/PlannerApp and removing remaining duplicates from Tools. Final counts: Projects/PlannerApp: 70 Swift files; Tools/Projects/PlannerApp: 0. Automation status: PlannerApp detected with 70 Swift files.

CodingReviewer-Modular consolidation:

- `Projects/CodingReviewer-Modular` contained 0 Swift sources and only duplicate workflow files. Removed the redundant Modular workflows (names already present at repo root) and left `CodingReviewer` as the single source of truth with 132 Swift files. Automation now lists 5 projects.

## Auto-Fix Branch Analysis (2025-09-03)

**Branch:** `origin/auto-fix/CodingReviewer-workflow`  
**Purpose:** Low-risk fixes (workflow splits, action pin bumps)  
**Status:** NOT MERGED - Too aggressive cleanup

### Findings:

- **✅ Beneficial Changes Extracted:**
  - ShellCheck integration replacing Trunk Check in validate-and-lint-pr.yml
  - Shell quoting fixes in deploy_workflows_all_projects.sh
  - Removal of problematic validate-only mode logic

- **❌ Risky Changes Identified:**
  - Deleted 293 workflow files including essential CI/CD workflows
  - Removed `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (Python test runner)
  - Removed `.github/workflows/automation-ci.yml` (multi-version CI)
  - No replacement workflows provided
  - Could break CI/CD infrastructure

### Action Taken:

- **Created new branch:** `shellcheck-integration`
- **Extracted good changes:** ShellCheck integration + script improvements
- **Preserved essential workflows:** Main CI/CD infrastructure intact
- **Committed as:** `a3c87cbf` - "feat: Extract ShellCheck integration and script improvements"

### Recommendation:

- **DO NOT MERGE** the auto-fix branch as-is
- **Future workflow cleanup** should be done incrementally with:
  - Clear inventory of essential vs redundant workflows
  - Replacement workflows for critical CI/CD functions
  - Gradual, tested removal process
  - Documentation of all changes

**Next Steps:**

- Test the extracted changes in CI environment
- Consider incremental workflow cleanup approach
- Document essential workflow dependencies
