## PR status report

Pending (remote refs exist):

Conflict policy used so far:

- Keep main’s versions for repo and project workflow files (.github/workflows/\*\*) and for shared automation.
- Accept additions and non-conflicting updates from PRs.
- If a PR deletes a workflow that exists in main, keep the workflow (prefer main).

Next targets:

- Probe and merge clean PRs one-by-one (e.g., #20, #21), running Automation status after each.

Last updated: automated during merge session.
