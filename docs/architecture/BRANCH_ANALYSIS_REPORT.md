# Branch Analysis and Pruning Report

## Executive Summary

This repository currently has a simplified branch structure with only one active branch (`copilot/fix-52`). However, documentation references multiple historical import and auto-fix branches that no longer exist. This report analyzes the current state and provides recommendations for branch management and cleanup.

## Current Repository State

### Active Branches

- **`copilot/fix-52`** (current): Active development branch for issue #52 (branch pruning analysis)
  - Status: ✅ Active and up-to-date
  - Action: **Keep** - This is the current working branch

### Missing Expected Branches

- **`main`**: Referenced in workflows but doesn't exist locally or remotely
  - Status: ❓ Expected but missing
  - Action: **Create** - Should be established as the default branch

## Historical Branch References Found

10. `import/ToolsAutomation/snapshot-20250826T130522Z`

**Status:** ❌ No longer exist (historical references only)
**Action:** **Update Documentation** - Remove stale references

### Auto-Fix Branches (From HabitQuest Triage)

Found in `Tools/Tools/Imported/Tools_snapshot_20250826T130522Z/Tools/Projects/HabitQuest/HABITQUEST_TRIAGE.md`:

1. `auto-fix/habitquest-triage` - Main triage branch
2. `auto-fix/habitquest-identifier-renames` - Identifier cleanup
3. `auto-fix/habitquest-line-wraps` - Line length fixes
4. `auto-fix/habitquest-split-views` - View splitting refactor
5. `auto-fix/habitquest-extract-functions` - Function extraction
6. `auto-fix/linewraps-1` - General line wrap fixes

**Status:** ❌ No longer exist (documented as planned/completed)
**Action:** **Update Documentation** - Clean up outdated branch references

## Workflow Configuration Analysis

### GitHub Actions Dependencies

The following workflows reference `main` branch:

- `.github/workflows/trunk.yml` - Triggers on push to main
- Documentation mentions main/develop branches in AI workflows

### Branch Strategy Implied by Workflows

Based on workflow analysis, the intended branch strategy appears to be:

- `main`: Stable production branch (currently missing)
- Feature branches: For development work
- Auto-fix branches: For automated improvements

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Create Main Branch

```bash
# Create main branch from current stable state
git checkout -b main
git push origin main

# Set main as default branch in GitHub settings
# Update local git config to track main by default
```

#### 2. Clean Up Documentation

Remove or update stale branch references in:

- `Automation/logs/remote_import_branches.txt`
- `Tools/Tools/Imported/Tools_snapshot_20250826T130522Z/Tools/Projects/HabitQuest/HABITQUEST_TRIAGE.md`
- Any other files referencing non-existent branches

#### 3. Update Workflow Files

Ensure all GitHub Actions workflows properly reference the main branch structure.

### Long-term Branch Management Strategy

#### Recommended Branch Structure

1. **`main`**: Default stable branch
   - Protected branch with required PR reviews
   - Target for all feature merges
   - Automated deployments and releases

2. **Feature branches**: Short-lived development branches
   - Pattern: `feature/description` or `copilot/issue-number`
   - Merged via PR to main
   - Deleted after merge

3. **Auto-fix branches**: Automated improvement branches
   - Pattern: `auto-fix/scope-description`
   - Created by automation tools
   - Merged via automated PRs when safe
   - Auto-deleted after merge

#### Branch Cleanup Automation

Consider implementing:

- Automatic deletion of merged feature branches
- Regular cleanup of stale import/snapshot branches
- Documentation updates when branches are created/deleted

## Impact Assessment

### Low Risk Actions

✅ **Creating main branch** - No existing branches conflict
✅ **Updating documentation** - Only affects documentation accuracy
✅ **Cleaning stale references** - Removes confusion

### Medium Risk Actions

⚠️ **Changing default branch** - May affect CI/CD if not coordinated
⚠️ **Branch protection rules** - Should be configured carefully

### No Risk Actions

✅ **Documentation cleanup** - Pure documentation improvements
✅ **Workflow file updates** - Improves consistency

## Conclusion

The repository needs minimal pruning since most referenced branches no longer exist. The primary actions needed are:

1. **Create missing main branch** - Required for proper workflow operation
2. **Clean up documentation** - Remove 16+ stale branch references
3. **Establish branch management strategy** - Prevent future confusion

This is primarily a documentation and configuration cleanup task rather than active branch pruning.
