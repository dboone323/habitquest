## Workflow Consolidation History

### October 6, 2025 - Phase 1 & 2 Consolidation

**Before:** 16 workflows  
**After:** 14 workflows  
**Reduction:** 2 workflows (12.5% ↓)

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Created `pr-validation-unified.yml` (combines 2 workflows)
2. ✅ Archived `pr-validation.yml` (generic PR checks)
3. ✅ Archived `validate-and-lint-pr.yml` (automation-specific checks)
4. ✅ Investigated `continuous-validation.yml` - KEEP (unique Swift validation)

**Impact:**
- Single entry point for PR validation
- Clearer organization
- Conditional path-based execution preserved
- All functionality maintained
- Easier maintenance

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reduced PR validation complexity
- ✅ Conditional execution still efficient
- ✅ Clearer workflow purpose
- ✅ Easier to maintain and update

## Quick Reference

### For Contributors

**When you open a PR:**
- `pr-validation-unified.yml` runs automatically
- `ai-code-review.yml` provides AI feedback
- `trunk.yml` checks code quality
- If you modified automation/workflows: additional validation runs

**When you push to main:**
- `optimized-ci.yml` runs (smart path-based checks)
- `unified-ci.yml` builds all Swift projects (if Swift files changed)
- `continuous-validation.yml` validates Swift code (if Swift files changed)
- `create-review-issues.yml` may create issues for review

**Nightly (automatically):**
- 00:00 UTC: Backup cleanup, compression, metrics cleanup
- 01:00 UTC: SwiftLint auto-fixes committed

**Weekly (automatically):**
- Sunday 02:00 UTC: Comprehensive health report

### For Maintainers
