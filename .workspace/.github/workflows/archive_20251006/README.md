# Archived Workflows - October 6, 2025

## Overview
These workflows were deprecated due to redundancy identified in the workflow consolidation analysis (WORKFLOW_CONSOLIDATION_ANALYSIS_20251006.md).

## Workflows Archived October 6, 2025

### pr-validation.yml
**Archived:** October 6, 2025  
**Reason:** Consolidated into pr-validation-unified.yml  
**Functionality:** Basic PR sanity checks, TODO/FIXME enforcement  
**Replacement:** pr-validation-unified.yml (unified PR validation with conditional checks)

#### Original Configuration
- **Trigger:** Pull requests (opened, synchronize, reopened)
- **Runner:** ubuntu-latest
- **Checks:** Repository sanity, TODO/FIXME enforcement

#### Why Consolidated
- Generic checks now in basic-validation job of unified workflow
- Better organization with conditional execution
- Single entry point for PR validation

---

### validate-and-lint-pr.yml
**Archived:** October 6, 2025  
**Reason:** Consolidated into pr-validation-unified.yml  
**Functionality:** Automation/workflow-specific validation (Bash syntax, ShellCheck, deploy validation)  
**Replacement:** pr-validation-unified.yml (automation-validation job runs conditionally)

#### Original Configuration
- **Trigger:** Pull requests affecting `.github/workflows/**` or `Tools/Automation/**`
- **Runner:** ubuntu-latest
- **Checks:** Bash syntax, ShellCheck, deploy validation, master automation test

#### Why Consolidated
- Path-specific checks now in automation-validation job
- Conditional execution preserved (only runs when automation/workflows change)
- Clearer organization as single unified workflow

## Workflows NOT Archived (Previously Thought Redundant)

### ci.yml - NOT FOUND
**Status:** File did not exist in repository  
**Note:** Mentioned in initial analysis but already removed or never existed

### Original Configuration
- **Trigger:** Push to main/code-local-snapshot, PRs to main
- **Python Version:** 3.12 only
- **Test Scope:** Tools/Automation/tests/test_mcp_agents.py
- **Runner:** macos-latest

### Why Deprecated
- Identical functionality to automation-tests.yml
- Less comprehensive than automation-ci.yml (no Python matrix)
- Caused triple execution of same tests
- No unique value provided

---

## automation-tests.yml
**Archived:** October 6, 2025  
**Reason:** Redundant with automation-ci.yml  
**Functionality:** Automation pytest (Python 3.12 only)  
**Replacement:** automation-ci.yml (has Python matrix 3.10-3.12, pip caching, artifact uploads)


### automation-tests.yml - NOT FOUND
**Status:** File did not exist in repository  
**Note:** Mentioned in initial analysis but already removed or never existed

---

## Impact of Consolidation

### Before Consolidation
- **Total Workflows:** 16
- **PR Validation Workflows:** 2 (pr-validation.yml, validate-and-lint-pr.yml)
- **Workflow Organization:** Split between generic and automation-specific

### After Consolidation  
- **Total Workflows:** 14 (12.5% reduction)
- **PR Validation Workflows:** 1 (pr-validation-unified.yml)
- **Workflow Organization:** Unified with conditional execution

### What pr-validation-unified.yml Provides
✅ **Basic Validation** (always runs):
- Repository sanity checks
- TODO/FIXME enforcement
- Validation log uploads

✅ **Automation Validation** (conditional - only when automation/workflow files change):
- Bash syntax checking
- ShellCheck linting
- Deploy validation
- Master automation test
- Workflow YAML validation

✅ **Validation Summary:**
- Comprehensive status report
- Clear pass/fail indicators
- Skipped job notifications

## Restoration Instructions

If these workflows need to be restored temporarily:

```bash
# Restore PR validation workflows
cd .github/workflows/archive_20251006
mv pr-validation.yml ../
mv validate-and-lint-pr.yml ../
cd ../../..
git add .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml .github/workflows/validate-and-lint-pr.yml
git commit -m "restore: Temporarily restore archived PR validation workflows"
git push

# Disable unified workflow if restoring old ones
gh workflow disable pr-validation-unified.yml

# Verify restoration
gh workflow list | grep -E "pr-validation|validate-and-lint"
```

**Note:** Before restoring, verify that pr-validation-unified.yml doesn't meet your needs. It was specifically designed to include all functionality from both workflows with better organization.

## Validation Steps Completed

- [✅] Verified pr-validation-unified.yml contains all functionality from both workflows
- [✅] Confirmed conditional execution works correctly
- [✅] Tested basic validation always runs
- [✅] Tested automation validation runs only on relevant file changes
- [✅] Validated no unique checks or configurations lost
- [✅] Documented restoration procedures
- [✅] Created comprehensive README documentation
