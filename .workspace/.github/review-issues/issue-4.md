Risks &amp; issues to address — Quantum-workspace

Primary risks:
1. Validate-only mode hiding failures
   - The validate-only behavior returns success even when validation errors exist. This can mask real problems.
2. Missing repo metadata and docs
   - No clear root README, license, or topics makes onboarding harder.
3. CI scaling and performance
   - Running full builds/tests for all projects on every PR will slow feedback loops.
4. Secrets &amp; deployment security
   - Scripts that deploy workflows require tokens; ensure least privilege and prefer OIDC where possible.
5. Lack of automated dependency/security scanning
   - If Dependabot/CodeQL not enabled, vulnerabilities may be missed.

Recommended mitigations:
- Make validation failures visible (or configure non-blocking checks in Actions instead of forcing script to exit 0).
- Add repo metadata and templates.
- Implement change-detection in CI and caching to speed runs.
- Use least-privilege tokens or OIDC for deployments.
- Enable Dependabot/CodeQL and secret scanning.
