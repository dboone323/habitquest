Concrete recommendations &amp; next steps — Quantum-workspace

Short-term (low effort)
- Add a root README describing repo layout and developer workflow.
- Add LICENSE, ISSUE_TEMPLATE, and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs Tools/Automation validation on PRs.

Medium-term
- Implement change-aware CI: detect changed projects (git diff) and run build/test only for those.
- Add CODEOWNERS for critical directories.
- Enable Dependabot (or Renovate) and CodeQL scanning.

Long-term / optional
- If projects are tightly coupled, keep monorepo and adopt a workspace tool (pnpm/yarn workspaces, Turborepo, Nx).
- If independent, consider splitting into separate repos and publish shared libraries to an internal registry.

Suggested first tasks you can do now:
1) Create README.md with workspace overview.
2) Add a PR workflow that runs Tools/Automation/ master_automation.sh --validate (or your script).
3) Configure Dependabot.
I can produce example files for any of the above (workflow YAML, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot config). Which would you like first?
