Observations &amp; immediate impressions — Quantum-workspace

What I observed:
- This repo appears to host workspace-level automation for multiple projects (scripts under Tools/Automation).
- There are scripts to validate and deploy GitHub Actions workflows across projects.
- A recent change added a "validate-only" behavior that reports validation errors but can return success.

Why it matters:
- Automation centralizes workflow management which is helpful for consistency.
- The validate-only change could mask pipeline issues if not handled carefully.
- There is no obvious root README or license visible in the reviewed files.

Actionable item: confirm intended behavior of validate-only runs and add/clarify repository-level documentation.
