https://github.com/dboone323/Quantum-workspace/actions
```
- Filter by workflow name
- Check run status (green ✓ or red ✗)
- Click run to see detailed logs

### Via GitHub CLI (from your terminal)
```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# Watch for specific workflow
gh run list --workflow=nightly-hygiene.yml
gh run list --workflow=swiftlint-auto-fix.yml
gh run list --workflow=weekly-health-check.yml

# View logs for latest run
gh run view --log

# Monitor in real-time (when workflow starts)
gh run watch
```

### Via Email (if enabled)
GitHub will email you workflow failure notifications by default.

## 📁 Where to Find Results

### Metrics Cleanup
**Location:** No artifacts - just log output  
**Check:** GitHub Actions logs for nightly-hygiene.yml run  
**Expected output:**
```
Deleted metrics older than 90 days: X files
Total metrics deleted: Y MB
Metrics remaining: Z files
```

### SwiftLint Auto-Fix
**If warnings found:**
- **New PR created:** Check https://github.com/dboone323/Quantum-workspace/pulls
- **PR title:** "fix: Auto-fix SwiftLint warnings [YYYY-MM-DD]"
- **PR description:** Lists all fixes applied

**If no warnings:**
- **Log output:** "No SwiftLint warnings found - nothing to fix"

### Weekly Health Check
**Location:** `Tools/Automation/reports/health_report_YYYYMMDD.md`  
**Contains:**
- Backup statistics (total, compressed, old)
- Archive health (size, file counts)
- Workflow statistics (runs, success rates)
- Storage usage trends
- Recommendations and alerts

**Access:**
```bash
# View latest health report
ls -ltr Tools/Automation/reports/health_report_*.md | tail -1
cat Tools/Automation/reports/health_report_*.md | tail -1
```

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Workflow Fails
1. **Check logs:** Click on failed run in Actions tab
2. **Look for error message:** Usually near the end
3. **Common issues:**
   - Permission errors → Check file permissions
   - Command not found → Tool not installed
   - Script syntax error → Check bash syntax

### Manual Trigger (if needed)
You can manually trigger any workflow:

```bash
# Via CLI
gh workflow run swiftlint-auto-fix.yml
gh workflow run weekly-health-check.yml
gh workflow run nightly-hygiene.yml

# Via Web Interface
# Go to Actions → Select workflow → Click "Run workflow"
```

### Disable Workflow (if problems persist)
```bash
gh workflow disable swiftlint-auto-fix.yml
# Fix issue, then re-enable
gh workflow enable swiftlint-auto-fix.yml
```
