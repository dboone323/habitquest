# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix - October 6, 2025

## Problem Identified

**Issue:** New workflows from PR #86 weren't appearing in GitHub Actions UI  
**Root Cause:** `.github` directory was a **symlink** pointing to `.workspace/.github`  
**Impact:** GitHub Actions couldn't discover workflows because it doesn't follow symlinks

## The Fix

### What Was Wrong
```bash
# .github was a symlink (git mode 120000)
.github -> .workspace/.github

# GitHub Actions only looks in .github/workflows/
# It doesn't follow symlinks, so workflows were invisible
```

### What We Did
1. **Removed the symlink** from git repository
2. **Created real `.github` directory**
3. **Copied all workflows** from `.workspace/.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/`
4. **Committed and pushed** to main branch

### Commands Executed
```bash
# Remove symlink
git rm .github && rm -rf .github

# Create real directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy workflows
cp -r .workspace/.github/workflows/* .github/workflows/
cp .workspace/.github/copilot-instructions.md .github/

# Commit and push
git add .github/
git commit -m "fix: Replace .github symlink with real directory..."
git push
```

## Results

### Before Fix
```bash
$ gh workflow list
NAME     STATE   ID       
Copilot  active  185911746
```
**Only 1 workflow visible** ❌

### After Fix
```bash
$ gh workflow list

## Why This Happened

### Original Setup
The workspace was designed with a consolidated structure:
- `.workspace/.github/workflows/` - Source of truth
- `.github` → symlink to `.workspace/.github`
- **Goal:** Single location for all GitHub configuration

### GitHub Actions Limitation
- GitHub Actions **doesn't follow symlinks** in repositories
- Workflows **must** be in `.github/workflows/` (real directory)
- Symlinks are ignored during workflow discovery

### Solution
- Keep `.workspace/.github/` for local development (if needed)
- Use **real** `.github/` directory for GitHub Actions
- Workflows are now in both locations for compatibility

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Workflows Are Visible
```bash
gh workflow list
# Should show 16 workflows including new ones
```

### 2. Check Workflow Files Exist
```bash
ls -la .github/workflows/
# Should show all workflow YAML files (not symlink)
```

### 3. Verify Git Tracking
```bash
git ls-files .github/workflows/
# Should list all workflow files
```

### 4. Check GitHub UI
Visit: https://github.com/dboone323/Quantum-workspace/actions/workflows
- Should see all 16 workflows
- New ones should have "Set up workflow" or "Run workflow" buttons

## Timeline Update

### Original Timeline (from POST_MERGE_TIMELINE)
❌ Workflows wouldn't have run (not visible to GitHub)

### Updated Timeline (Now)
✅ **Tonight 00:00 UTC (~5 hours):** Nightly Hygiene will run  
✅ **Tonight 01:00 UTC (~6 hours):** SwiftLint Auto-Fix will run  
✅ **Sunday 02:00 UTC (~31 hours):** Weekly Health Check will run  

All workflows are now properly registered and will trigger on schedule!

## Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status
```bash
# List all workflows
gh workflow list

# View specific workflow
gh workflow view "Nightly Hygiene & Observability"
gh workflow view "SwiftLint Auto-Fix"
gh workflow view "Weekly Health Check"

# Monitor runs
gh run list --workflow=nightly-hygiene.yml
gh run list --workflow=swiftlint-auto-fix.yml
gh run list --workflow=weekly-health-check.yml
```

### GitHub UI
**Actions Page:** https://github.com/dboone323/Quantum-workspace/actions

Filter by:
- "Nightly Hygiene & Observability"
- "SwiftLint Auto-Fix"
- "Weekly Health Check"
- "PR Validation (Unified)"

## Success Metrics

✅ **16 workflows visible** (up from 1)  
✅ **3 new automated workflows** active  
✅ **1 new PR workflow** active  
✅ **Scheduled runs** will trigger tonight  
✅ **GitHub Actions** can now discover all workflows  

## Lessons Learned

1. **GitHub Actions doesn't follow symlinks** - Always use real directories
2. **Workflow discovery happens at push** - New workflows appear immediately after push
3. **Test locally first** - Use `gh workflow list` to verify visibility
4. **Symlinks are valid for local dev** - But not for GitHub Actions integration

## Next Steps

### Immediate
✅ Done - Workflows now visible and active!

### Tonight (~5 hours)
⏳ Monitor first Nightly Hygiene run (00:00 UTC)
⏳ Monitor first SwiftLint Auto-Fix run (01:00 UTC)

### Tomorrow Morning
