## 📊 Daily Monitoring Checklist

### Morning Check (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Check GitHub Actions for overnight runs
open https://github.com/dboone323/Quantum-workspace/actions

ls -lt Shared/Tools/Automation/backups/ | head -20

# 3. Check for SwiftLint commits (after tomorrow)
git log --oneline --grep="SwiftLint" --since="1 day ago"

# 4. Check metrics directory size
du -sh Tools/Automation/observability/snapshots/
```

### Weekly Check (10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Review weekly health report (Sundays after 02:00 UTC)
cat Tools/Automation/reports/weekly_health_*.md | tail -100

# 2. Check workflow health report
cat Tools/Automation/reports/workflow_health_*.md | tail -100

# 3. Verify backup compression stats
grep "Compression complete" .github/workflows/logs/*.log

# 4. Check for any CRITICAL issues in GitHub
open https://github.com/dboone323/Quantum-workspace/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:CRITICAL
```

## 🚨 Alert Conditions & Responses

### CRITICAL Alerts (Immediate Action)

#### 1. Backup Explosion Returns (>50 backups/day)
**Symptoms:**
- Backups directory growing rapidly
- Multiple backups within minutes

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check deduplication is working
grep "Skipping backup" Shared/Tools/Automation/ai_enhancement_system.sh

# 2. Check last backup timestamp
ls -lt Shared/Tools/Automation/backups/ | head -5

# 3. Verify cooldown period
grep "BACKUP_COOLDOWN" Shared/Tools/Automation/ai_enhancement_system.sh
```

**Resolution:**
- Should self-correct with 1-hour cooldown
- If not, check for infinite loops in automation scripts
- Review BACKUP_FREQUENCY_INVESTIGATION_20251006.md

#### 2. Disk Space <10GB
**Symptoms:**
- Low disk space warnings
- Backup compression failing
- Metrics cleanup failing

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check disk usage
df -h

# 2. Find largest directories
du -sh */ | sort -rh | head -10

# 3. Manual cleanup if needed
./Tools/Automation/observability/compress_old_backups.sh
./Tools/Automation/observability/cleanup_old_metrics.sh
```

**Resolution:**
- Run manual compression/cleanup
- Verify automated cleanup is working
- Check for unexpected large files

#### 3. Workflow Failures (3+ consecutive)
**Symptoms:**
- Multiple failed workflow runs
- No successful runs in 24h

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check workflow status
gh run list --limit 10

# 2. View failure logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# 3. Check for common issues
grep "error\|failed\|fatal" .github/workflows/*.yml
```

**Resolution:**
- Review error logs for root cause
- Check for dependency issues
- Verify GitHub Actions quota not exceeded

### WARNING Alerts (Monitor Closely)

#### 1. Backup Frequency 20-50/day
- Monitor for increasing trend
- Review backup deduplication logic
- Check for new automation scripts creating backups

#### 2. Metrics Directory >2GB
- Verify cleanup_old_metrics.sh running
- Check retention period (90 days default)
- Consider reducing retention if needed

#### 3. SwiftLint Auto-fix Commits >5/day
- May indicate new code quality issues
- Review what's being auto-fixed
- Consider updating SwiftLint rules

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Commands

### Debug Backup Issues
```bash
# Check backup deduplication logic
cat Shared/Tools/Automation/ai_enhancement_system.sh | grep -A 20 "should_create_backup"

# List recent backups with timestamps
ls -lth Shared/Tools/Automation/backups/ | head -20

# Check backup file sizes
du -h Shared/Tools/Automation/backups/*.tar.gz | sort -rh

# Verify compression is working
file Shared/Tools/Automation/backups/*.tar.gz
```

### Debug Workflow Issues
```bash
# Check workflow syntax
actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml

# View recent workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=nightly-hygiene.yml --limit 10

# Check workflow triggers
grep -r "on:" .github/workflows/*.yml

# View workflow logs
gh run view --log
```

### Debug Metrics Issues
```bash
# Check metrics directory
ls -lth Tools/Automation/observability/snapshots/ | head -20

# Verify cleanup script
bash -n Tools/Automation/observability/cleanup_old_metrics.sh

# Run cleanup in dry-run mode
# (modify script to add --dry-run flag if needed)

# Check metrics file sizes
du -sh Tools/Automation/observability/snapshots/*
```

### Debug SwiftLint Issues
```bash
# Check SwiftLint configuration
cat .swiftlint.yml

# Run SwiftLint manually
swiftlint lint --strict

# Check auto-fixable issues
swiftlint lint --fix --format

# View SwiftLint version
swiftlint version
